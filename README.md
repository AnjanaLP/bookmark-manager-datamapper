# Bookmark Manager

I have rebuilt my previous version of Bookmark Manager using Datamapper to gain insight into how ORM libraries work. This time I have also deployed the application to Heroku, although not attractive (need to work on styling!), it's great to be able to visit something I made https://guarded-sea-84811.herokuapp.com
